# Data Structures And Algorithms

Everything related to data structures and algorithms that I've coded.

**Usage**

1. Clone repo
1. run `npm install` or `yarn` (to run tests for data_structures). Skip if not testing data_structures.
1. To test individual problems: Eg, run `node leetcode/array_string/0001_two_sum.js`.

> Note: Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Cracking the Coding Interview

**To create file**: From the chapter folder, run `ch_01_arrays_and_strings$ node ../create_file.js '9 String Rotation' 1`.

The resulting file will be `1.09_string_rotation.js`. Omitting the optional chapter `1` at the end, will result in the filename `09_string_rotation.js`.
